## Solutions to some algorithmic problems in Python

These are some of my implementations in Python to problems I have come across from online courses and the web. They commonly appear during whiteboarding interviews. 
In addition, you can find some game implementations (see Game of Fifteen for getting a good understanding of using the Python Tkinter GUI library).

Please respect academic honesty policies in case these problem sets are part of your curriculum.
